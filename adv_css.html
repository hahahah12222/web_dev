          <h2> why I love the movie!</h2>
          <p> I love the movie because I use to be a dancer and the dancing is very good! It really connects to me and I am also in love with Patrick Swayze. In the movie he dances with the protagonist and falls in love with her. I wish i was the protagonist in the story so I could dance with him and we could get married. I do think i would be a better partner for him then her but the overall story is really good and really connects to me and the music is really good.
