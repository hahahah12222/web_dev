         <h2>Plot</h2> 
         <hr>
         <p> Frances "Baby" Houseman, a 17-year-old who has a summer romance with Johnny Castle, a poor dance instructor at the hotel where her family is vacationing in 1963. Baby becomes Johnny's dance partner after his original partner, Penny, is having a baby and decides to have an abortion, and they fall in love, leading to conflict with Baby's father and Johnny's return to perform a final dance with Baby. </p>
         
         <h2> Why I Love the Movie!</h2>
         <p> I love the movie because I use to be a dancer and the dancing is very good! It really connects to me and I am also in love with Patrick Swayze. In the movie he dances with the protagonist and falls in love with her. I wish I was the protagonist in the story so I could dance with him and we could get married. I do think I would be a better partner for him then her but the overall story is really good and really connects to me and the music is really good. </p>
