             <h2> why I love the movie</h2>
          <p> I love the movie becuase I think it gets the social classes about high school great. It starts with a bunch of high school students that are all in detention. They are all dirffrent social classes and the prinipal is awful. They try to escape and in that prosses relize they are all more common then they think. This moveie is a great movie and I would recomend it to everyone over the age of 14.
